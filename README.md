### Download

You can get builds from either Modrinth or CurseForge:

https://modrinth.com/mod/little-logistics-quilt/
https://curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/little-logistics-quilt

### Features

Unlike the [Forge version](https://github.com/MuradAkh/LittleLogistics) this version
is missing quite a few things. As of now, only vessels (tugs and barges) have been implemented,
but without chunk loading abilities.

### Bugs & Contributions

Contributions are welcome. If you want to fix a bug, feel free to open a PR. If you
found one, but can't fix it yourself, file an issue.
If you have a feature suggestion please head over to the [Forge version repo](https://github.com/MuradAkh/LittleLogistics)
and file an issue, as this repo only reimplements their existing features.
